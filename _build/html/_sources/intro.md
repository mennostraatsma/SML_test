# Spatial Machine Learning



- Machine learning
- Spatial machine learning
- Working with remote sensing images
- unsupervised classification
- supervised classification
- change detection

Each chapter consists of a notebook that combines text with code. Formative questions test your understanding and small coding exercises deepen your skills working with spatial data. You are expected to actively work with these coding exercices, but the answers are given if you get stuck. At the end of each chapter there is an assignment, for which no answers are provided within the notebook.

## Prerequisite knowledge
For these notebooks we assume a basic knowledge of 
- Python, and specifically the numpy, pandas and geopandas packages
- QGIS for overlay of data and visualization
- QGIS for digitization of polygons of labeled reference data.
